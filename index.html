		<p>A webpage on GitHub for free? Hell yeah.</p>
		<p>I'll put effort on this eventually.</p>
		<div id='newthing'><p>NEW: <a href="./articles/articles.html">Blogs and articles</a> (poorly maintained)</p></div>

		<p> I was supposed to put some webpages I had in development a long time ago, but since it was part of a victim of my <a href="https://twitter.com/dandee808/status/1683813357240057857?s=20">foolishness</a>, the backups of the HTML webpage (along with other of my files) did not survive inside the hard drive and got overwritten. I was quite mad and disappointed.</p>
		<p>For now, you can have a look at my Twitter, or rather, X (fuck you, Elon), and my YouTube page. I'm mostly active on Twitter, and I <b>swear</b> I'm working on a video on YouTube. Bye for now!</p>

		<h2><u><a href="https://www.twitter.com/dandee808">Twitter</a></u> - @dandee808</h2>
		<h2><u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dandee008">YouTube</a></u> - I swear I'm working on something.</h2>

		<p>To-do lists:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create an about me page</li>
				<li>Create a CV page</li>
			</ul>
		<p>ad goes here. Sorry for the ads, but I need revenue to fix my laptop screen :( pls disable adblock</p>
